/*
FOO needs to be called as a subroutine. To do that, invert the logic of your jump, and use the CALL instruction to call FOO. Put a RET instruction at the end of the FOO routine.

TESTIT PROC
    CMP AX,1
    JLE  BAR
    CALL FOO
BAR:
    RET
TESTIT ENDP

FOO:
    ;do something
    RET
END FOO

MAIN:
    CALL TESTIT
    .EXIT
END MAIN
